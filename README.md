# Indy-Archieve-Document-Classification

# Problem Statement
Document classification is a problem faced by many organizations globally. As documents increase in volume, their capacity to be stored multiplies and manual document annotation has become expensive, unscalable, and impractical. To rectify this problem, data scientists now employ many modes of algorithms with the goal of classifying these documents automatically.

Indianapolis is also not immune to this problem, and thus this project began in collaboration with The Polis Center of Indianapolis in order to solve this very problem: “How can we classify large numbers of text articles from the Encyclopedia of Indianapolis based on subject?”. 

The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis contains thousands of entries ranging from the subjects of bibliographic timepieces of influential individuals, to descriptive geography, and centuries of recorded events - all of which are currently unlabeled.

# Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to automate the document classification process by building a predictive model to classify them into categories of geography, time, person, and organization.

This categorization will facilitate archival and search of articles for years to come and get rid of the mundane tasks of reading and annotating articles manually.
